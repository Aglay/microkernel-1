// Note: It seems that the right approach is to have several tasks. 
// 1. Clock: Each time there's a tick the task should print the new time. 
// 2. Commands: Another task should read commands from the terminal. 
//    This task should be in charge of reading the input from the cmd line and 
//    send the commands to the train. 
// 3. Sensor: Another task should be in charge or reading sensor data. 
//    This includes reading switches and sensors. 


// Print the "initial screen"

// Handle the timer. 

// Read sensors

// Send commands

// Deal with switches
